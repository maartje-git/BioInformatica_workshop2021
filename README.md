# BioInformatica_workshop2021
everything related to the bioinformatics workshop 2021 I will put here

January 2021 I started with the BioInformatics workshop, provided by the NIOZ BioInformatics people. Every week there is a lecture and some practice assignments.
In this repository I will post everything related to this course.

I'll have to figure out how to get Jupyter and GitHub work together
